# DermaGAN

DermaGAN is a deep learning project that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic dermatology images and enhance the performance of skin lesion classification models. Designed to tackle the challenge of limited and imbalanced dermatological datasets, DermaGAN contributes a novel dual-model pipeline combining GAN-based data augmentation with a custom CNN classifier. The model is trained and classifies images into four different classes: Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, and Benign Keratosis.

## üß† Motivation

Accurate skin lesion diagnosis through AI often suffers due to insufficient or imbalanced image datasets. To bridge this gap, DermaGAN introduces synthetic data generation using GANs to augment underrepresented classes and improve classifier robustness. The goal is to enable earlier detection of skin conditions, particularly skin cancer, through better-trained diagnostic models.
